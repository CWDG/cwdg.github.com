    <h2>How do I get started?</h2>

    <p>
      The best way to get started is to show up to our meetings. Also, you should <a href="http://eepurl.com/GBJFv">join the mailing list</a> to stay up to date on meetings. Before you attend your first meeting, you may want to familiarize yourself with the <a href="http://ruby-lang.org">Ruby Programming Language</a> or <a href="http://nodejs.org">Node.js</a>. We also maintain <%= link_to "a list of resources", "/resources.html" %> to help new members get up to speed.
    </p>

    <p>
