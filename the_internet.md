# Basics

### What You Need to Know as a Web Developer
- Page Markup
- Client-Server
- Request-Response

## Page Markup
- HTML
- Your content

- CSS
- How it looks

- Javascript
- Change things!

- "Front End"

## Clients and Servers
- Website with many users
- 1 server - many clients
- Content can change per client

## Request/Response
- How does your browser (client) communicate with the website (server)?
- Browser asks for a resource from the server
  - http://www.example.com/about.html
    Host: www.example.com
    GET /about.html HTTP/1.1
- Server sends a response
  - 200 OK
  - 304 Not Modified
  - 404 Not Found
  - 500 Server Error
  - HTML
- Browser often then sends more requests.

# Browser Specifics

# What, Not How
- Declarative, not Instructive
- Java/C/etc. says "do this, then this"
    document.drawString("Welcome to Example.com", myfont, size, ...)
- HTML says "this needs to be displayed, the browser can work it out"
    <h1>Welcome to Example.com</h1>

## Structure of the Page: HTML
- Hypertext Markup Language

## Style of the Page: CSS
- Cascading Stylesheets

## Interaction on the Page: Javascript
