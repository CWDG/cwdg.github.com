        %h2 Meetings
        %p
          We are currently meeting every Tuesday at 7:00pm in Dreese Labs room 264. We try to spend equal time on presentations or discussion and then switch gears to pairing to work on the quarterly project. We also use IRC for a lot of informal discussion throughout the week.

        %h2 Project
        %p
          Getting your hands dirty is the best way to learn. That's why we make an effort to take some project from concept to completion each semester. This gives us practical experience with all the technical challenges, design, project management, and collaboration.
