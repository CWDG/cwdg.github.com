              Bring your laptop because this part is going to be fun.
              Learn to build web apps right there in the meeting and try out
              the crazy new topic discussed in earlier.

              #### ...Windows?

              We thrive on Open Source. Most of the technologies we
              will be speaking about aren't very well supported on
              Windows. Don't have Linux or Mac? No problem, we can
              help you get setup with a fresh install of Ubuntu or you
              can work off a live cd and push your work to Github when
              the night is over.
