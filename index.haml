              We are currently meeting **every Tuesday** at **7:00pm** in **Dreese
              Labs** room **369**. Most meetings will be on campus at this
              location. Sometimes these meetings will be tutorials are other
              small projects while other days there might be a guest speaker.

          %h2 How do I get started?
          .content
            :markdown
              The best way to get started is to show up to our
              meetings. We generally shoot for a split meeting
              format. The first hour we will present a topic to the
              members. The second hour is for them to explore that
              topic on their own laptop to gain experience.

              Before you attend your first meeting, it is recommended
              you follow our
              [Developer Setup Tutorial](dev_ruby_setup.html "Developer Machine Setup")
              so you can be productive as soon as you start.

              You may also want to familiarize yourself with the
              [Ruby Programming Language](http://www.ruby-lang.org/ "Ruby") or look over
              our past meeting materials to familarize yourself with the topics you've missed.

              If you do nothing else, **[Sign Up For The Mailing List](http://go.osu.edu/cwdglist)**
              so we can let you know about all the sweet things we are doing.

              Bring your laptop because this part is going to be fun.
              Learn to build web apps right there in the meeting and try out
              the crazy new topic discussed in earlier.

              #### ...Windows?

              We thrive on Open Source. Most of the technologies we
              will be speaking about aren't very well supported on
              Windows. Don't have Linux or Mac? No problem, we can
              help you get setup with a fresh install of Ubuntu or you
              can work off a live cd and push your work to Github when
              the night is over.
