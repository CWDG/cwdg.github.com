          <div class='content'>
            <p>This guide will show you how to setup your computer to follow along
            with all the CWDG sessions. Everything we use here will be used again
            countless times during the course of your web development career.</p>
            
            <p>The goal for tonight is to run a simple web server and publish the code
            to the internet.</p>

        <div class='section rvm'>
          <h2>1. Setup the Ruby Version Manager</h2>
          <div class='content'>
            <p>First we will install RVM. This is a program which does some basic
            path manipulation to ensure you are using the correct version of ruby.</p>
            
            <p>It is recommended that you simply follow the
            <a href="https://rvm.io/rvm/install/">Installation Instructions</a> on the
            <a href="https://rvm.io/">main RVM website</a>. The project is quite well documented
            in both <em>how</em> to use RVM and also <em>why</em>.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Apple Users</strong> take note! Make sure you look into the
            <a href="https://rvm.io/os/osx/">Special Instructions</a> for your computers.</p>
            
            <p>If you are a audio/video person, you can check out the
            <a href="http://screencasts.org/episodes/how-to-use-rvm">RVM Screencast</a>,
            but your milage may vary.</p>
            
            <p>I also recommend you run <code>rvm requirements</code> and make sure all the required
            libraries are installed correctly. This will prevent problems down the
            road and add a few optional, but wonderful features to ruby.</p>
            
            <p>Once RVM is installed, I recommend you close all your terminal windows.
            Reopening your terminal, you can check to make sure that rvm is working.</p>
            
            <blockquote><p><code>rvm list</code></p></blockquote>
            
            <p>If the command works, you may see something similar to</p>
            
            <blockquote><pre><code>rvm rubies&#x000A;&#x000A;=* ruby-1.9.3-p194 [ i686 ]&#x000A;&#x000A;# =&gt; - current&#x000A;# =* - current &amp;&amp; default&#x000A;#  * - default&#x000A;</code></pre></blockquote>
            
            <p>You may not have any "rubies installed". I recommend that you then run:</p>
            
            <blockquote><p><code>rvm install ruby-1.9.3</code></p></blockquote>
            
            <p>While this is doing it's thing (it will take a while), you can move
            onto steps 2 through 4.</p>

          <h2>2. Install Git</h2>
          <div class='content'>
            <p>We also want to make sure we can save our work permanently. We will use the
            version control system <a href="http://git-scm.com/" title="Git Source Control Manager">Git</a>.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Linux Users</strong>: Your favorite package manager will have a package for git.
            You have my word as the anonymous narrator of this guide.</p>
            
            <blockquote><p>For example, <em>Ubuntu Users</em> will use the command <code>sudo apt-get install git</code>.</p></blockquote>
            
            <p><strong>Apple Users</strong>:
            You have a couple of options. If you are using Homebrew, use <code>brew install git</code>.
            If you have no idea what Homebrew is, you can simply
            <a href="http://git-scm.com/download/mac">Download Git</a> from their
            <a href="http://git-scm.com/" title="Git Source Control Manager">website</a>.</p>
            
            <p>If you get lost, Github provides
            <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git">detailed instructions</a>
            that are much better than mine.</p>

          <h2>3. Signup for a Github Account</h2>
          <div class='content'>
            <p>We want somewhere to put our code. As we are learning, we will be making our
            code <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">open source</a>. This
            is fantastic because we can learn from each other.</p>
            
            <p>We can also use <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> for <em>free</em>!</p>
            
            <p>Go <a href="https://github.com/signup/free">Sign Up</a> now.</p>
            
            <p>Github has <a href="https://help.github.com/">fantastic documentation</a> detailing how
            to use Git and take advantage of their services. You can explore this yourself now.
            We will also begin covering git in more detail later this semester. Very useful
            tool to know how to use. <em>+1 Marketable Skill</em>.</p>

        <div class='section ssh-keys'>
          <h2>4. Setup SSH Keys</h2>
          <div class='content'>
            <p>In order to use git from your terminal, you will need to setup some authentication
            keys. Github uses SSH keys to authenticate users attempting to push code to
            a repository (save code).</p>
            
            <p>They have a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys">awesome guide</a>
            for this. It is even tailored to your favorite operating system!</p>
            
            <p>When generating your keyfiles, any options in [brackets] are default options.
            I recommend you leave the filename of the keys to be their default (id_rsa).</p>
            
            <p>You know you've got it <em>working correctly</em> if you are able to run the command</p>
            
            <blockquote><p><code>ssh -T git@github.com</code></p></blockquote>
            
            <p>and see the output</p>
            
            <blockquote><p><code>Hi *USERNAME*! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not&#x000A; provide shell access.</code></p></blockquote>
            
            <p>When you get this working, you know you're doing great.</p>

            <p>Now that you have RVM with ruby-1.9.3 installed, we can start using ruby. You are
            going to run the command</p>
            
            <blockquote><pre><code>gem install sinatra&#x000A;</code></pre></blockquote>
            
            <p>This will install the <a href="http://sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra Web Framework</a>. It will be
            our tool of choice for the next few weeks as we explore web development.</p>

          <h2>6. Create Your First Website</h2>
          <div class='content'>
            <p>Now we get to <strong><em>CREATE</em></strong>! Create your first website!</p>
            
            <p>The plan: We are going to create a project directory, a server file, a
            documentation file. We'll then see our creation run in our browser.
            Finally we'll push the results to Github.</p>
            
            <p>Open your terminal and open a <a href="#text-editors">text editor</a>. Run:</p>
            
            <blockquote><pre><code>mkdir -p ~/cwdg_projects/hello_sinatra&#x000A;cd ~/cwdg_projects/hello_sinatra&#x000A;</code></pre></blockquote>
            
            <p>Copy the following text into your text editor and save the file as <code>hi.rb</code>:</p>
            
            <blockquote><pre><code>require 'sinatra'&#x000A;&#x000A;get '/hi' do&#x000A;  "Hello World!"&#x000A;end&#x000A;</code></pre></blockquote>
            
            <p>This is going to create a page that just says "Hello World".</p>
            
            <p>Now you will start the server by running:</p>
            
            <blockquote><pre><code>ruby hi.rb&#x000A;</code></pre></blockquote>
            
            <p>It should output something similar to <code>Listening on 0.0.0.0:4567</code>.</p>
            
            <p>You can look at this page by pointing your browser at
            <a href="http://localhost:4567">http://localhost:4567</a>. You should get an error page
            from Sinatra ("Sinatra doesn't know this ditty").</p>
            
            <p>Now go to <a href="http://localhost:4567/hi">http://localhost:4567/hi</a>. You should
            see "Hello World!" in your browser.</p>

            <p>Now we need to save this success for posterity.
            <a href="https://github.com/new">Create a New Repo on Github</a>. Name it
            <code>hello_sinatra</code> or whatever you like. Check "public" and hit "create repository".
            Now we'll follow the directions on the next page.</p>
            
            <p>With your text editor, save a file called README.md in this directory with the text:</p>
            
            <blockquote><pre><code>A basic Sinatra app.&#x000A;</code></pre></blockquote>
            
            <p>In your terminal, run:</p>
            
            <blockquote><pre><code>git init&#x000A;git add hi.rb&#x000A;git add README.md&#x000A;git commit -m "Basic Sinatra App"&#x000A;git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/hello_sinatra.git&#x000A;git push -u origin master&#x000A;</code></pre></blockquote>
            
            <p>Make sure you used your own Github username. <em>YOUR_USERNAME</em> is a placeholder.
            Replace it with whatever your real username is. You can check the
            <a href="https://github.com/saterus/hello_sinatra">example I created</a> if you like.</p>
            
            <p>Check the Github page again. You should see your code saved to Github now!</p>

            Follow <a href="https://rvm.io/packages/zlib">these

            <li>Try thinking of your problem in its general terms, then typing them into Google.
            If you have a specific error message, try that.
            <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> is a pretty good resource for

            well, but are likely just going to confuse you. You might want to try
